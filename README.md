# K-NN-Classifier
1. Implementation of the brute force K-NN algorithm for binary classification
2. Data pre-processing and feature selection techniques
3. Model evaluation techniques


We will be evaluating various K-NN models on the white wine portion of the Wine Quality dataset from UCIâ€™s repository:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality. In order to carry out this evaluation, we will:
1. Implement two distance metrics (Euclidean and Manhattan)
2. Implement the brute-force K-NN algorithm
3. Implement a cross-validation function
4. Apply scaling to the dataset
5. Perform feature selection
6. Evaluate your model
